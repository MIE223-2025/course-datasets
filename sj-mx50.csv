The mattresses are cozy and the rooms are lovely. Excellent customer service used to be offered at every desk. I'm a lifetime Elite member with Marriott, and according to availability, I should get a free upgrade when I check in. They haven't upgraded me or even mentioned it the last few times I've checked in. The previous time I went there, I requested an upgrade and was told there was nothing available because they were virtually sold out. I made the decision to add another night the following morning. When I called, a young woman answered the desk phone. I questioned her about whether the Palms Suite was open that evening. After putting me on hold, she answers the phone and assures me it's not. So I inquired as to whether I may transfer across to one of the grande suites. I can transfer to one, the woman informs me; it just needs to be cleaned, and she'll phone me when it is. A few hours later, I still hadn't heard from her, so before heading down to the desk, I utilized the Bonvoy chat to inform the employees that I was still awaiting word regarding switching over. I'm sorry, the desk clerk says, but an ambassador has a reservation for that room, therefore it's not available. She approaches me while still helping others in her line and adds, \""It was me you talked to and I never said anything about an upgrade.\"" She then turned and walked away while shooting me a filthy look. She spoke in a very nasty and, in my opinion, very unprofessional tone. to turn around from a guest she was checking in so she could come over and be disrespectful to me. I never mentioned an upgrade either. I looked back at the desk agent that was helping me and I told him I didn't like her attitude. \nMarriott should not have someone who doesn't have customer service skills working their desk. As a side note that suite stayed empty all night. I'm pretty sure I was lied to about the availability of suites because they'd rather keep them available for someone who's going to pay way more to rent it. I can understand that. However, free upgrades should not be listed as a perk for those of us who are lifetime elite members. Especially when we can't even get one after we've asked for one and they have them available.

The morning offerings include a buffet, ordering a la carte off the menu, and even an array of take-away options which are fairly priced. There is also complimentary Starbuck's coffee in the morning and refreshing fruit-infused water in the afternoon and evening.  All in. all, my week at the AC was excellent.

Although it is something we'd not trade in for the world- it is extremely overwhelming...It definitely requires a break that is ABSOLUTELY necessary.. That said, we've made it a point to go to a hotel when we can to have peace of mind, and to take care of tasks we must in order to regain normalcy in our own lives. That said, we normally stay at a place in Los Gatos or Campbell- However in our search we were looking for something a bit more local. Surestay had come up MANY times within our search- It's always had the best rates, and a location right near where we need to be. However...We continually skipped over it...Again and again and again...\nAnd for no good reason. As humans we judge, and tend to follow the words of others mindlessly. Using opinions to measure the quality of a place we've not even so much as looked into. It's embarrassing when I think about it. \n\nLast week, my fiance and I decided give Surestay a try. Boy were we surprised! \nThe first thought I had was \""Wow. I cannot believe I'd skipped through this so many times\"" I genuinely felt stupid. \n\nThe Building is CLEAN. The grounds are CLEAN. The ROOMS are CLEAN. The linens, sheets, desk etc is clean. There is absolutely NO REASON anyone should skip this hotel and or question a stay here. I've booked 100s of hotels in my life and the one thing I'm huge on is service and cleanliness. This Surestay exceeded my expectations. So much so that we stayed twice on two different occasions. \nThe prices for rooms vary from $84 and up. What you get for that price is a STEAL. \nThe Staff at Surestay is also very very nice as well. I don't recall all of the names as I wish I did, however I do want to mention that they were all great. Yes the parking gets full on top, however there is plenty of parking just RIGHT downstairs. It's not far at all. I'd also like to mention that it is not odd at all that Holiday in is next door. Plenty of hotels all over are next to one another. That shouldn't ever be an issue in determining a stay. Especially with the fact that Surestay does offer NICE rooms. \n\nA Brand doesn't determine the quality of the hotel, the staff does- And it is apparent that Mohammed and his staff are doing an EXCELLENT job. \nMy only ONE complaint out of everything is that I came here for rest...hoping I'd have no interruptions..The maids came around 830\u002F9 knocking on the door repeatedly and then came in. I will assume they didnt hear me through the door. The second stay it happened again to ask if I was staying another night..this was around the same time.. It states on the Surestay site that checkout is 12. I couldn't understand why I was woken up out of a deep sleep. My biggest pet peeve is being woken up before my alarm when I've had little to no sleep. I've NEVER had that happen before. Ever. \nI really needed a break and was exhausted..I couldn't sleep after that and was pretty upset. I got over it obviously. Ultimately, I don't believe it was done purposely, and maybe it's something they do there that I've never come across. Next time I'll be sure to turn the sign to do not interrupt and try to ensure that doesn't happen. They were sweet enough to bring me a new key when I wasn't feeling well. So I must look at everything as a whole and not just that incident. \n\nMy point in all of my long rant is- PLEASE DO NOT allow negative experiences of others determine whether you will stay or not. Judge the place on your own. The price is so low, be grateful and see that they go above and beyond expectations- literally. People assume the area = not good. This is a prime example that holds no truth. \n\nThank you all for being so kind and helpful,  and for keeping up the rooms! You are all doing a great job and should know that! This Surestay location exceeds its expectations BECAUSE of the staff. \nDon't be like us or anyone else who didn't stay over opinions that are irrelevant and in no way are a reflection of what IS.

Most every time we left the room, when we came back, our key cards didn't work. We had to get new ones daily. When we asked the dismissive employee at the front desk about this, he told us that it was likely because the people who keep giving us our room keys are too lazy to set them for the entirety of our stay, and instead only activate them for one day at a time. He assured us the keys he was giving us would work through the remainder of the stay, but they failed to work immediately upon our return to the room. We stayed here due to fire evacuation, and when we went to extend our stay, they gave us a new room. The carpet in the new room was one-third soaked so that when you stepped on it water oozed out. We assumed it was an issue with the air conditioner which made loud, watery noises, and did not even work. This was room 320. We told them about the issue, worrying that it may result in leakage to the room below us or even mold in the long run. They ended up moving us again, telling us to move to 306, before almost immediately correcting themselves so that we were assigned room 316. We packed all of our belongings and moved to 316. When we used the key to open the door, someone was already staying in there! They gave us someone else's room! We were outraged and asked for yet another room, telling them of our horror story. They moved us to room 331, where there was no plug for the bathtub, nor were there any towels. Like all of the other rooms, this room was filthy and loud. We went down and asked for a plug, which the woman at the front desk finally provided us after asking a multitude of questions about what exactly we were asking for. We asked for towels, and she stated that they would only give us new towels if we brought our used towels to them. We stated that the room had no towels to begin with, and she proceeded to only give us one towel, stating that we could come back in an hour if we wanted another. We are still waiting for that towel. When we went to do laundry, we left our load in for the time it said it would take to complete. When we came back (very shortly after we presumed it would be done), someone had removed our laundry despite there being two other machines, and despite the fact that we had not even left it there for very long! We were embarrassed and uncomfortable at the thought of someone touching our laundry, particularly during a global pandemic. We talked to other guests whose room keys continued to fail as well, and swapped even worse horror stories with other guests who were having similar experiences. The area and people were fairly shady, and the hotel was actually loudest at night into the AMs. I advise anyone reading this to stay anywhere else! Worst hotel stay of our lives!

Upon arrival with my wife (she and I were paying for the room) were informed that my son's ID was needed to stay in the room.  His ID was stolen over a month prior after he was assaulted, and he'd not yet had it replaced.  However, we were able to produce a full color photocopy (front and back) because we keep them for all valuables (e.g. credit cards, ID's, etc.).  Was informed by the manager that this was insufficient, and their policy was that the guest must produce an actual physical ID.  Ironically, we had just the day before checked my son out of an Extended Stay about 15 miles away where he had been residing for the past six weeks.  That Extended Stay was close to his job, but we had decided to move him closer to us for our convenience connecting with him, and helping him get to the grocery store (he does not drive).\nThe Manager (Rico) would not budge on the policy, so we moved our son to a nearby hotel for a few days hoping to sort it out.  I reached out to Extended Stay Guest Services (don't bother with your canned and insincere response, because I HAVE already contacted you directly), and was informed that I would be contacted by a District Manager within forty eight hours.  Having received no additional contact, I continued to try to reason with Guest Services, but was informed that only a District Manager could allow the manager of the hotel to grant an exception to their rule about requiring a physical ID.  \nA week later I made a new reservation for myself at the hotel, plus a guest.  Upon arrival was told by Rico that because my son did not have an ID, I could not check into the hotel myself.  In other words, despite any experience I have had checking into a hotel previously (and since), at Extended Stay Hotels the policy is that all adults who will reside in the hotel must produce a physical ID.  Either that, or their manager was being obstinate.\nIn any case, I informed Rico that I needed to resolve the situation immediately, because I was leaving town, and wanted to see my son situated before I left.  I literally begged him to contact the District Manager by phone, but he refused.  Said that he'd sent them an email, and that was the most that could be done.\nTo summarize - over the course of a week, I spoke to Extended Stay Guest Services over five times.  I spoke with representatives Stephanie, Matt, Samantha, Shaniqua, and Mariah over those days, and each time was assured that the District Manager (Salguni P) was aware of the need to speak with me, and would be in touch.  Nico said the same thing.  I had a Case Number (29763792) that is apparently meaningless, because I have never been contacted by anyone at Extended Stay.\nI moved my son into a Marriott Residence Inn directly next door to the Extended Stay Hotel, and had absolutely zero issue checking in.  My son did not have to produce any ID, and although I did end up paying a slightly higher rate for the room I reserved for the months of September and October, upon check-in I was upgraded from a Studio to a One Bedroom Suite, which I assure you was infinitely nicer (cleaner, and much nicer amenities) than Extended Stay.\nIt's really too bad that E.S. can't get their act together, and hasn't a clue what Guest Services truly means.  However, lesson learned.  I'll never be staying in one of their hotels (or another brand owned by the same company) again.  Pre-pandemic I traveled for my work regularly, and it looks as though that will be starting again soon, so good to know what places to avoid for the future.",1,negative,"September 24, 2021",6199 San Ignacio Ave,"('San Jose',)",California,95119-1389

First...the restaurant listed on the website is closed and has been since Covid. The hotel needs a major renovation. The plumbing needs to be checked. Poor water pressure with low flow. My husband believes there is heavy build up in the pipes.\n\nRoom #1 was an accessible room with 2 double beds. It did not have a handheld shower sprayer, even though there was a bar for one. Just a regular shower head. The lamps were not plugged into the wall so my brother had to fix that. One day there was no hot water. My mom couldn't take a bath since there was no handheld shower sprayer and cold water. The lamp heater in the bathroom was missing it's knob so it was unusable. The desk chair tried to dump you forward so we switched it with the chair in our room, that we ended up moving from.\n\nRoom #2 had a king bed. \n1st room given to us was room #218, across the hall from my brother & mom. It had a sickly sweet smell like overused room freshener. I had to wait in the hallway because it was giving me a headache while Tim, who was great, checked out a 2nd room to make sure it was okay before he moved us to it. We ended up in room 204 down the hall.\n\nThere are too many things to list that went wrong during our stay. Husband had to go down to the desk to get missing soap, missing wash clothes &, hand towels. Had to get a replacement wash cloth & hand towel after housekeeping took old but didn't replace them. Our bathmat was folded on the bathtub edge like it was new, but it was our dirty wet one from earlier. Over our 3 night stay I ended up killing 3 baby roaches. The one day of no hot water applied to both rooms, not just my brother's. No bathtub stopper. Only 3 hangers in our king bed rooms. No ice buckets, just a plastic bag. You should see the review I did directly with Wyndham. My husband always leaves a tip for housekeeping when we travel but not this time.\n\nWhen my husband went down to pick up towels, he described the desk person like a bum that came in off the street and started working there. A plain black t-shirt, no name badge and he needed a comb or brush run through his hair. He was just plain disheveled. I'm done.
