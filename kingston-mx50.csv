Our room was fine and met expectations, which were for a standard motel room that was functional but not much more.  There were a few things missing, which we got when we asked for them (or didn\u2019t bother asking).  There was also one quite significantly broken\u002Fseparated piece of floor moulding, which wasn\u2019t a big deal, but did reinforce our impression of this being a low budget accommodation, which is what we knew we had signed up for.\n\nThe room was actually a bit larger than expected.  It had a bar fridge and a microwave.  The black-out curtains were great and we were able to sleep without being woken up by the sunlight.  The biggest complaint was about the thin walls, which allowed us to hear the conversation in the room next door \u2013 not just muffled sounds, but word-for-word conversations.  Given that the property didn\u2019t seem too busy, it might have been nice if they had left a vacant room between each occupied room to avoid this problem.

Location is fine if you have a car, but being next to a busy stroad is not exactly scenic, but a short drive from the actual nice bits of Kingston.

data_kingston_50/ca/154992/281339/859069755.html,Strata Hotel,"""I was staying in Kingston on Queen's infamous \""one-day move-in\"" weekend, where every parent is scrambling for a room after waiting 4 hours in traffic gridlock around the university. I'd read the reviews and knew the hotel was under construction, so I expected that. Here are the pros and cons: \n\nPros: \nThe room was new, with nice floors, a very comfortable bed, and while the room was warm when I came in I turned on the AC and it cooled down quickly. Very nice bathroom with the new special lighted mirrors, and a small reading light above the bed. There was a desk and a TV and a quiet fridge, and a comfortable wingback chair near the windows with a lamp over it for reading. The people at the front desk that I dealt with were kind, and for what it was, the hotel overall served its purpose. While I knew the hotel was solidly booked that night, I didn't experience any running in the halls or noise from other rooms, so it felt pretty soundproofed on the walls, which I really appreciated.\n\nCons: \nSo just to describe the hotel: it's built into the end of a plaza, so what looked like it might have been a fitness store is now the front lobby (and as other reviews have said, wires are sticking out of the walls and it looks junky\u2014I described it to my friend as looking like Saul Goodman's plaza law office when he first bought it in Better Call Saul), then you go out into what used to be the hallway of the plaza to get onto an elevator, and the rooms are the two floors of living space that are above the existing stores. The parking lot is small and not well lit, so when I first arrived at 10pm it was dodgy. There were no spots left when I got there so I parked in the parking garage, only to realize the door that was marked \""To the lobby\"" only works if you already have a key. So I got back in the car and had to move it over to one of the stores in front of the plaza and walk back to the lobby with my bags. \n\nThe elevator takes a while so I just took the stairs. Early one morning someone spilled coffee down the stairs and because it was probably more dangerous to clean it and get the stairs wet, they left it throughout the day so it was always sticky when I was coming and going. It was cleaned by the following morning. \n\nMy room was at the far end of the hall, at the farthest end away from the lobby, but I had a stairwell, so on the first day I thought this is actually convenient since my car was parked closer to that end of the hotel anyway. I went down the three flights of stairs, only to be faced with an emergency exit only that would sound an alarm, and two other locked doors. I had to go back up to the second floor and all the way down that very long hallway to get back to the lobby and exit that way. Some signage on the third floor letting guests know they couldn't exit that way would have been helpful. \n\nWhile the bathroom was really nice, the shower had water that trickled out so slowly and with such low water pressure it took me ages to get the shampoo out of my hair. I don't know if I've ever encountered such a light water pressure, and I've been in some pretty bad showers. For a brand-new system and reno, you'd think they would have improved that. \n\nI wanted ice one night, and came down to the desk to ask and the attendant pointed to a small personal ice-maker on the tabletop and said that's the only ice and you can only fill one cup for an individual drink. I just said okay and walked back upstairs. I hope they're planning to include ice machines in the future. \n\nThe traffic on Princess St. was loud when I was going to bed, but with the AC on it drowned out the sound, although I did jerk awake a couple of times to large trucks loudly applying their engine brakes outside. My room faced the street so I don't know if perhaps the back rooms facing behind the hotel might have been a little quieter, but it didn't bother me much to be honest. \n\nOverall the room served its purpose and was fine. But it felt a little dodgy at night as I was travelling solo as a woman, and it's not somewhere I'd return to if I had the choice of other hotels. But if you're just looking for a nice room and really nice bed and don't have thick hair to get shampoo out of (ha), then I think the hotel will suit your purposes.",3,negative,"September 8, 2022",1187 Princess St,"('Kingston',)",Ontario,K7M 3E1

Rooms have been renovated and are exactly as described in words (coffee, ironing board & iron, big tv, fridge, microwave and the website pictures are accurate.  I did like the heated bathroom mirror (no fogging). Beds are fantastic and 4 pillows per bed. A simple but suitable modern lobby. Outside the entrance is a patio with 2 picnic tables, Muskoka chairs and patio furniture to seat about 40 with a propane fire pit, I sat there in the evenings and still got the Wifi. Some renovations may still be happening but not at all noticeable and no noise. There are businesses below the hotel but none are noisy.  It appears the hotel bought the whole complex as the big sign on the property says Strata Center. The hotel is also on a main bus route.\n\nLocal area has a new Pizza Hut (take out) beside the hotel and a Food Basics one building away. A & W, McDonalds, Wendys, Loblaws, Shoppers also near by. I recommend a little place called the Yellow Cafe, not far (they have locations around the world), great decor ! and a great breakfast (yogurt parfait was big and delicious with berries, bananas, apples, strawberries). A cute store attached with breads, teas and other quality goods. I was travelling with two seniors age 79 and 85 and my mother loved The Yellow Cafe. Talk to the staff to hear about The Yellow Cafe concept. Organic eggs etc. I had the Turkey Breakfast sandwich. If you're all about garbage fast food chains, skip it but if not then go.\n\nI was sitting alone in the lobby and staff came round and offered me a treat from a tray, nice touch.

We had originally booked to stay 2 nights but added a 3rd once we arrived just because we loved it so much and, luckily, they were able to accommodate us. While breakfast is not included in the stay, there are plenty of places to eat nearby. And with the little in-room kitchenettes, you can bring cereal, milk and fruit etc (they also have a toaster, fridge, and coffee maker) and do your own simple breakfasts before hitting the beautiful pool on the grounds and\u002For hitting the town. Worth every penny. Immaculately clean rooms, comfortable beds, and the most friendly staff anywhere who went above and beyond for us when we needed extra towels for our children and a late check out when running a little behind. This is a charming oasis, with beautiful grounds, amenities, and rooms and you will not be disappointed if you choose to stay here. Our kids especially loved the slide and swings on site and we loved the opportunity to barbecue and eat outdoors. Bring your bug spray if it\u2019s a summer stay and you plan to hang out outside after dusk. We will most DEFINITELY be back next year.

This time we decided to try something different and we were so pleasantly rewarded. We stayed at this past weekend Aug 21-22 as it was my birthday. This hotel was extremely clean and had everything we could need. The beds were very comfortable and the room was spacious.  There were many small details that the larger chain hotels miss, It is an amazing spot if you have children and need them to have space to play. The grounds are beautiful and the outdoor pool was clean . When swimming it felt like we were on vacation  in New Orleans somewhere . The beautiful surroundings and trees brings peace and calm .

My daughters came across the Green Acres Inn from an internet search when we were doing when researching places to stay in Kingston . They brought it to my attention as there was an outdoor pool advertised . Well , I found out pretty quickly that Green Acres Inn had more to offer than just that great outdoor pool. Booking the stay was a pleasure . Sara was very helpful and friendly .  We booked two inter connecting rooms which was great as it really added to our comfort level . Both rooms were renovated , clean and nicely decorated.  Rooms had Mini kitchen with microwave and fridge and some basic utensils. Note gas bbq on site which was a plus .  The pool was great , the lovely green grounds were great and oh that cute little gazebo . \nNote there is AC which was also a plus but one of the units was very noisy. That\u2019s really the only issue we had.  I will definitely recommend this place to anyone wishing to stay in Kingston . The owner should be proud . The staff was very friendly and helpful .

We were told it was far from downtown, but it was much closer than expected, plus it kept us away from all the crowds!  We were so impressed with this little Inn on the outskirts of town. There are so many stores and restaurants located very close by, and while not directly downtown it was only a very short drive (approx 10 minutes to the Pen).

data_kingston_50/ca/154992/182874/916854296.html,Green Acres Inn,"""I stayed in a Classic Queen room. The room looked lovely on the website and in fact, it is nicely renovated and furnished. However, the room smelled musty the afternoon I arrived to check in. The air conditioner was not turned on despite the previous few days having been unusually hot but the front window was left open. I opened a back window to get a cross-breeze to air the room out and I reported the problem to the front desk person asking if there was an air conditioner in the room. Yes, he said, over the back window. So I left for my event, returning after the office was closed.\n\nThe smell had improved somewhat. I decided to turn the air conditioner on and found to my dismay that it's location could only be reached by standing on furniture - not a safe thing for anyone to do and even with getting up to reach the controls I could not see what was what.  I found the Power On button and turned it on. When I wakened there was still the whiff of mustiness; I left for my event and left the air conditioner going.\n\nHowever, when I returned the room was awful. The front desk was still open and I asked or (demanded) (a) to be moved and (b) to have the innkeeper, Heather Ford, get in touch with me. I was moved to a double queen room in the lower section of the Inn - those rooms all have air conditioners at floor level. This room was very nice; my only complaint is that I could not reach the blind on the back window so had no privacy on that side of the room\n\nThe innkeeper did not get in touch with me despite an assurance from the front desk person that she would. I didn't want to write a Poor review if she planned to fix the problem:\n- repair or replace the air conditioner in room 20 and check all others in the Classic Queen rooms. \n- take steps to ensure no guest has to stand on furniture to turn on the air conditioner. For example, I suggested that the staff turn it on before guest arrival - and set it for 70 degress F. And post a note saying that if it needed to be adjusted to call the front desk - who would presumably have a step stool to reach it properly",2,negative,"September 16, 2023",2480 Princess St,"('Kingston',)",Ontario,K7M 3G4
